## Technical Specifications

### Blockchain Infrastructure
Bitcoin Supreme operates on the **Solana blockchain**, chosen specifically for its revolutionary technical capabilities that address the fundamental limitations of traditional blockchain networks.

**Solana's Technical Advantages:**

**Ultra-High Performance**: Solana's unique Proof of History (PoH) consensus mechanism enables processing of up to 65,000 transactions per second, compared to Bitcoin's 7 TPS and Ethereum's 15 TPS. This massive throughput ensures BTCS transactions are executed instantaneously, even during periods of high network activity.

**Minimal Transaction Costs**: Average transaction fees on Solana remain below $0.01, making BTCS ideal for micro-transactions, frequent trading, and DeFi interactions. This cost efficiency enables use cases that would be economically unfeasible on other networks.

**Sub-Second Finality**: Solana's block time of approximately 400 milliseconds ensures near-instantaneous transaction confirmation, providing users with immediate settlement and eliminating the uncertainty associated with longer confirmation times.

**Energy Efficiency**: Solana's consensus mechanism consumes significantly less energy than Proof of Work systems, aligning with modern sustainability requirements while maintaining robust security guarantees.

**Ecosystem Maturity**: Solana hosts a thriving ecosystem of DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces, and developer tools, providing BTCS with immediate access to a comprehensive suite of financial services and integration opportunities.

### Token Standards & Implementation

**SPL Token Standard**: BTCS is implemented as an SPL (Solana Program Library) token, ensuring full compatibility with the Solana ecosystem and adherence to established security and functionality standards.

**Smart Contract Architecture**: Our smart contracts are built using Rust programming language, leveraging Solana's high-performance runtime environment for optimal execution speed and security.

**Cross-Program Invocation**: BTCS smart contracts utilize Solana's cross-program invocation capabilities, enabling seamless integration with existing DeFi protocols and future ecosystem expansions.
